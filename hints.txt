Objectives

    Recreate Hangman using constructors, objects and Node.js
    Process user input via the command line

Instructions

    Create a new folder called Week11-Hangman

    Inside the Week11-Hangman folder, create the following:

    Make files called game.js, letter.js, main.js, and word.js
    Using these files, you are going to be putting together a console-based hangman application which utilizes constructors, objects, and user-input in its solution.
    The application should select a random word from the game.js
    Both letter.js and word.js should be constructor files:
        word.js should contain all of the methods which will check the letters guessed versus the random word selected.
        letter.js should control whether or not a letter appears as a "_" or as itself on-screen.
    main.js is where the game is played and contains all of the user-input.
        The application should end when a player successfully guesses a word or runs out of guesses.



// Contains the logic of your app. Running it in Terminal/Bash will
// start the game.

// 3) main.js: main file to run. requires prompt and word.js

// game object:  main game logic.

// game.wordbank: can have word bank of different words.

// game.wordsWon


// wordsWon : integer that tracks how many words have been 
// guessed correctly.

// game.guessesRemaining : integer for guesses per word

// game.currentWrd : the word object

// game.startGame : method to start game. takes in a word object. 
// Reset guesses remaining using resetGuessesRemaining. Get 
// random word from word bank in game.js. Populate currentWrd 
// (made from Word constructor function) object with letters.
// Continue prompting user with this.keepPromptingUser.

// game.resetGuessesRemaining : resets guesses remaining to 
// the default amount

// game.keepPromptingUser : uses prompt module and get method to 
// retrieve and store letter user inputs. Output the letter 
// guessed to terminal. Check if letter was found using 
// checkIfLetterFound() and save the value into a variable. 
// Use the variable to check if the user guessed incorrectly 
// minus the number of guesses they have left via console.log. 
// If they guessed the letter correctly, then congratulate them 
// via console.log. if they guessed the word correctly, 
// congratulate them on winning and return to exit game. 
// Render the word using wordRender() and display letters 
// user has guessed already.     if guessesRemaining is greater 
// than 0 and word has not been found, use keepPromptingUser(). 
// Otherwise, end the game and log out what the answer was.

// Require word.js:
var inquirer 	= require('inquirer');
var word 		= require('./word.js');

// GLOBAL VARIABLES:

var lettersInWord 		= [];
var numBlanks 			= 0;
var blanksAndSuccesses 	= [];
var wrongLetters		= [];

// Game Counters:
var winCount			= 0;
var lossCount			= 0;
var guessesLeft			= 0;

// MAIN PROCESS

startGame();

// Captures Key Clicks
document.onkeyup = function(event) {

	// Determines which exact key was selected. Makes it CAPS.
	// FIX THIS TO ONLY ACCEPT ALPHANUMERIC KEYS. Right now, arrow 
	// keys, etc. are being logged as entries.
	var userGuess = String.fromCharCode(event.keyCode).toUpperCase();
	checkLetters(userGuess);
	roundComplete();

	// Show the letter guessed:
	console.log('You guessed ' + userGuess);
